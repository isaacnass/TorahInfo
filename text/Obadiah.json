Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research.","This text began as an electronic transcription by Richard Whitaker (Princeton Seminary, New Jersey) and H. van Parunak (then at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor) of the 1983 printed edition of Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS). It was continued with the cooperation of Robert Kraft (University of Pennsylvania) and Emmanuel Tov (Hebrew University, Jerusalem), and completed by Alan Groves (Westminster Theological Seminary).  The transcription was called the Michigan-Claremont-Westminster electronic Hebrew Bible and was archived at the Oxford Text Archive (OTA) in 1987. It has been variously known as the \"CCAT\" or \"eBHS\" text. Since that time, the text has been modified in many hundreds of places to conform to the photo-facsimile of the Leningrad Codex, Firkovich B19A, residing at the Russian National Library, St. Petersberg; hence the change of name.","The J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research has continued to scrutinize and correct this electronic text as a part of its continuing work of building morphology and syntax databases of the Hebrew Bible, since correct linguistic analysis requires an accurate text.","Vocalized ketib variants are no longer included as they are not part of the original manuscript.","The only changes to the J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research text by the transcriber are: The book names in English and Hebrew of the Jewish Publication Society Tanach and book abbreviations from the New Revised Standard Version have been added. Six transcription notes (5,7,10) have been moved to the noted character (Lev 11:42.4, Judg 18:30.11, Isa 9.6.1, Ps 80:14.3, Job 38:13.5, Job 38:15.2) "]},"sourceDesc":{"biblItem":[{"title":["Hebrew Bible","Leningrad Codex"],"editor":["Shemu'el ben Ya'akov","Aharon ben-Mosheh ben-Asher"],"edition":"Original document","imprint":{"publisher":"Russian National Library (Saltykov-Shchedrin)","pubPlace":"St. Petersburg (Leningrad)","date":"1008"},"idno":"Firkovich B 19 A"},{"title":"Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia","editor":["Kittel, Rudolf, 1853-1929","Alt, Albrecht, 1883-1956","Eissfeldt, Otto, 1887-","Kahle, Paul, 1875-1964","Elliger, Karl, 1901-1977","Rudolph, Wilhelm, 1891-"],"edition":"Fourth","imprint":{"publisher":"Deutsche Bibelstiftung","pubPlace":"Stuttgart","date":"1983"},"idno":{"_":"3-43805218-0","type":"IBSN"}},{"title":[{"_":"Bible.
